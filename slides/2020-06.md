### Rules?

We don't have CoC...

...so just be nice to each other :)

Note:
- probably we are resonable enough, so that no CoC is necessary
- don't make sth similar to what politicians do: they divide us, so lets not do it here
- be nice, sell your ideas without 
- everyone is welcome here: minorities, foreigners etc.
- has sth uncomfortable happened? reach out to us (organizers)
