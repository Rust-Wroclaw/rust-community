## Meetings format
- 'long' talks (~30 minutes)
- lightning talks
- workshops
- coding
- discussion panel

Note:
presentation longer than 30minutes is a lot of work
you should be capable of selling your idea within half an hour
----

## Engagement

**Community = YOU!**

----

### Do not ask what we can do for you...

- help organizing?
- want to give a talk?
- or run a workshop?
- want to talk about your project...
- ...or something else Rust related?
----

### Rules?

Do we need a CoC?

... or just be nice to each other?

Note:
- probably we are resonable enough, so that no CoC is necessary
- don't make sth similar to what politicians do: they divide us, so lets not do it here
- be nice, sell your ideas without 
- everyone is welcome here: minorities, foreigners etc.
- has sth uncomfortable happened? reach out to us (organizers)
